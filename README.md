# COVID-19 Mortality Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains an in-depth analysis of factors influencing COVID-19 mortality rates across local authorities in England. The study uses a combination of statistical techniques, including ANOVA tests, correlation analysis, factor analysis, and regression modeling, to investigate the impact of various demographic, health, and socio-economic variables on COVID-19 mortality. The results aim to provide insights for policymakers to reduce public health disparities and mitigate mortality rates during pandemics.

## Key Features

- **Data Analysis**: The project integrates and analyses data on COVID-19 deaths from NOMIS Data Portal along with socio-economic, demographic, and health-related factors.
- **Statistical Techniques**: The study employs hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, ANOVA tests, and regression modeling to identify key predictors of COVID-19 mortality.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Using linear regression and stepwise regression models, the study predicts total deaths and explores the relationships between variables like health status, household deprivation, and employment.
- **Visualizations**: The project includes data visualizations to illustrate findings and trends related to COVID-19 mortality.

## Project Structure

- **Data**: The dataset used includes demographic and health data from various local authorities in England, integrated into an Excel sheet and processed in R.
- **Scripts**: The analysis is carried out using R scripts, which include the following:
  - **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts for cleaning and transforming data.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Descriptive statistics and visualizations to uncover patterns and trends in the data.
  - **ANOVA Testing**: Scripts for running ANOVA tests to compare different models.
  - **Regression Modeling**: Multiple linear regression models to predict total deaths based on various factors.
  - **Factor Analysis**: Used to identify underlying factors contributing to mortality.
- **Results**: Summarized results and interpretation of the models and statistical tests.

## Installation

To run this analysis on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-mortality-analysis.git
   cd covid19-mortality-analysis
   ```

2. Install the necessary R libraries:

   ```R
   install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "dplyr", "car", "lmtest", "corrplot"))
   ```

3. Open the R scripts located in the `/scripts` folder and run them in your R environment.

## Usage

1. **Data Integration**: The data from the NOMIS Data Portal has been preprocessed and integrated into a clean dataset for analysis. Make sure the data file (`covid_data.csv`) is available for running the analysis.

2. **ANOVA Tests**: The ANOVA tests compare different models, including demographic, health, and socio-economic variables, to identify the best fit for predicting COVID-19 mortality. The full details of the tests are in the `anova_tests.R` script.

3. **Model Comparison**: The regression models compare multiple variables to determine the best predictors of mortality. The results are discussed in the `results.R` script and provide insights into how these factors contribute to mortality.

4. **Visualizations**: Various graphs and plots are included to visualize key patterns and insights, such as the correlation between health factors and mortality rates, and the impact of socioeconomic variables.

## Results

- The study shows that health factors like "Very_bad_health" and "Bad_health" are strongly correlated with higher mortality rates, as well as demographic factors like age (especially the elderly and young populations).
- Socioeconomic factors such as "Household_deprivation" and "Part_time" employment status also significantly impact mortality rates.
- Models that incorporate socioeconomic variables, such as Household Deprivation, proved to be more accurate in predicting COVID-19 mortality than simpler models.

## Future Work

- **Data Expansion**: The dataset can be expanded by including more geographic regions or detailed demographic data to enhance model generalizability.
- **Machine Learning**: Further research could explore advanced machine learning techniques for more accurate predictions.
- **Temporal Analysis**: Incorporating temporal data would allow for trend analysis over time.
- **Interaction Effects**: Exploring interaction effects between variables such as health status and socio-economic conditions could improve the model.
